# Blade Runner Live Coding 🌌

An atmospheric, retro-futuristic experience merging procedural ambient music with a "live coding" visual narrative.

## Overview

This project is an homage to the aesthetic of *Blade Runner*. It uses the **Web Audio API** to generate Vangelis-inspired pads and cinematic reverb in real-time, coupled with a **Canvas-based** rain simulation and CRT visual effects.

## Features

- 🎹 **Procedural Audio**: Real-time synthesizer pads with deep, cavernous reverb.
- 🌧️ **Dynamic Rain**: A physics-based rain simulation rendered on HTML5 Canvas.
- 📟 **Live Code Narrative**: An automated terminal that "codes" the music as you listen.
- 📺 **CRT Aesthetic**: Scanlines, flicker, and vignette effects for a true retro-future feel.

## Credits

- **Concept & Development**: Created by [Elorri79](https://github.com/Elorri79) using **Antigravity** (Google DeepMind).
- **Inspiration**: The cinematic world of Blade Runner and the synthesizer mastery of Vangelis.
